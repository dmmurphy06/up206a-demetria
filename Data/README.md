 **Dataset #1**
 
* Leave benefits: Access, civilian workers, March 2020 (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
* This dataset shows leave benefits and the percentage of workers that have access to them in general, by sector, size of firm and region. I am interested in the percentage of workers that have access to paid family leave in Southern California.
* [Source Link](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2020/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2020.pdf) Given that this dataset is for California at large, it may need to be scaled for the Southern California area.
