 **Dataset #1**
 
* Employee Leave benefits: Access, civilian workers (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
* This dataset shows leave benefits and the percentage of workers that have access to them in general, by sector, size of firm and region. I am interested in the percentage of workers that have access to paid family leave in Southern California.
* [Source Link](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2020/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2020.pdf) - Given that this dataset is for California at large, it may need to be scaled for the Southern California area.

 **Dataset #2**
 * Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months by Sex By Age (Black or African American Alone) (2019 ACS 5 Year Est.)
 * This data set shows Black poverty status by gender.  Iâ€™m interested in what correlations exist between poverty status and paid family leave. Are families in deeper poverty more likely to have less access to paid leave? Showing this allows one to see the breakdown of one type of care infrastructure and the prevalence of it in specific communities.
