# <hl> About Me
Hey everyone! My name is **Demetria Murphy** and I am a **2nd year MURP** focusing on **Community Economic Development and Housing**. My interests include infrastructure of care and the future of work. I consider *both* Los Angeles and Las Vegas, NV home. Audre Lorde proclaimed boldly:
  >When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in service of my vision, 
  >then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.

This perfectly sums up my mindset embarking on the world of GIS and Spatial Data Science. I am excited to get to know and learn from all of your work.
# <hl> Course Description
This course, Intro to GIS and Spatial Data Science, is focusing on using *both* of these as **tools of analysis of urban issues**, yesterday, today, and tomorrow and **vehicles of urban policy change**.
# <hl> My Course Goals
My goals for this course are:
* Use **data visualization** to communicate a **compelling argument** about urban issues and **narrative** grounded in data 
* Develop working knowledge of **sentiment analysis** and the **possibilities of spatial analysis** in **urban justice** related issues
* Create **place-based hypotheses** about an urban issue based on spatial analysis 
* **Communicate data clearly for others** to develop their **own spatial analyses** on an urban issue and influence policy change
# <hl> Project Ideas
One idea I have is to better map the state of Black work in California beginning with data collected by the Essential Stories Project, a movement building advocacy campaign created to uplift the voices and experiences of Black workers in California to ensure there is comprehensive and long-term COVID-19 recovery support, resources, and protections. Here is the [initial data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vclyxwB25PSnze9b7YTpuXSVra5JiBJz2AJQ77eUOqI/edit) from the project.
