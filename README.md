#My name is Demetria and I am a 2nd year MURP focusing on Communoity Economic Development and Housing.
#This course, GIS and Spatial Data Science, is focusing on using data visualization as a tool of analysis of urban issues, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
#My goals for this course are to use data visualization to communicate a compelling argument and narrative grounded in data.
#One idea I have is to better map the state of Black work beginning with data collected by the Essential Stories Project, a movement buidling advocacy campaign created to uplift the voices and experiences of Black workers in California to ensure there is comprehensive and long-term COVID-19 recovery support, resources, and protections.
