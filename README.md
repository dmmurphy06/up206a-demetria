# <hl> About Me
Hey everyone! My name is **Demetria Murphy** and I am a **2nd year MURP** focusing on **Community Economic Development and Housing**. My interests include infrastructure of care and the future of work. I consider *both* Los Angeles and Las Vegas, NV home. Audre Lorde proclaimed boldly:
  >When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in service of my vision, 
  >then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.
#I'd like to think this perfectly sums up my mindset embarking on the world of GIS and Spatial Data Science. I am excited to get to know and learn from all of your work.
# <hl> Course Description
This course, GIS and Spatial Data Science, is focusing on using data visualization as a tool of analysis of urban issues, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
# <hl> Course Goals
My goals for this course are to use data visualization to communicate a compelling argument and narrative grounded in data. Additionally, I am interested in learning more about sentiment analysis and the possibilities with machine learning.
# <hl> Project Ideas
One idea I have is to better map the state of Black work beginning with data collected by the Essential Stories Project, a movement building advocacy campaign created to uplift the voices and experiences of Black workers in California to ensure there is comprehensive and long-term COVID-19 recovery support, resources, and protections. Here is the [initial data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vclyxwB25PSnze9b7YTpuXSVra5JiBJz2AJQ77eUOqI/edit) from the project.
